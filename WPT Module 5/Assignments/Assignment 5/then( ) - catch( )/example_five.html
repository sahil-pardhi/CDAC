    1. Create a Promise that resolves with the number 10 after 3 seconds <br>
    2. Create another Promise that resolves with the number 20 after 5 seconds <br>

    How can we log out the sum (30) of these two resolved values
    once, after BOTH promises successfully fulfill? <br>

    <script>
        const promise1 = new Promise( (resolve, reject) => {
            setTimeout( () => {
                resolve(10);
            }, 3000);
        });

        const promise2 = new Promise( (resolve, reject) => {
            setTimeout( () => {
                resolve(20);
            });
        });

        Promise.all([promise1,promise2]).then( (value) => {
            console.log(value);

            const n1 = value[0];
            const n2 = value[1];

            console.log("N1 : " + n1 + " N2 : " + n2);
            const sum = n1 + n2;
            console.log("Sum : " + sum);
        })
    </script>
